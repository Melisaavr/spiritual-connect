## Features

### Navigation 
It is located at the top of the page under the header. 
The navigation links: get started, about, classes, contact us offer links to the relevant sections. 
The text is in subtle "middle ages" font which is relevant because astrology dates back to the middle ages and when the so-called "witch" profile was more prevalent.

### The Header
The header shows the name of the website and reflects a community with the "connect". 
It is placed in the middle, with the navigation right below it. This is so that it is emphasized and set apart from the rest of the content. 
Text colour is white above a dark purple background. This signifies power and wisdom.
